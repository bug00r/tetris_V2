Things i want to do with this Game:

Version 1:
	- change render method from event based to sheduled one with frame counter(update 60 times per second) 
	- add animation of line removement(maybe in Version 2 first)(Prio. 2)
	- add Options UI with all kind of states
	- More specific Scoring Algorithm(Prio. 3)
	- cleanup and document code(Prio. 1)

done:
	- rewrite field draw calculation for start extreme Tetris
		- here we have to interpolate block_size
	- Adding simple Sounds
	- drawing algorithm one time Field and only Stone should be redrawn
	- smoother controlling with Game State
	- app_state		//are you in game, or in startscreen or in options
		- input_state	//input types and so on
		- game_state	//need input_state What was happened inside of the game like new stone, lines removed, ston moved or rotated, stone was getting fix
		- ui_state		//need game state and input_state(custom events for animations), will decide which part of ui should be redrawn 
			- gfx_state
			- sfx_state
		
Version 2:
	- add usage of customizing Textures
	- add UI LIB, there is a very good one calls nuklear. Here we have only to add our own drawing methods, rest is managed. TOP!!!

Version 3:
	- add features like:
		- rocket, bombs different Stones away
		- antigravity, for a specific time frame the stone movement slows down
		- wormhole, you can goto the left and stone reaches the right side and reverse

Version 4(optional but a good idea):
	- create abstraction layer for ui, sfx and gfx. We want to have regular function and a Framework layer which will do the wohle work
		- it should be easily to switch
